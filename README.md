============
>Still in progress

In this repo you will find an iOS app I am developing during my *master's degree in mobile applications*.
The specifications are to create a library and get used to collectionViews, TableViews and SplitViewController.

Besides, I want to add REST API connection, which I am making possible thanks to [studiodev](https://twitter.com/studiodev)'s  [mocky.io](https://github.com/studiodev/mocky) service, image caching and CocoaPods.

I think this project is a good opportunity to create my own *to-read* books library, so I have set up a JSON array with the books I have found the most interesting for an StartUp (Coding, UX Design, Web development...). You can find it [here](http://www.mocky.io/v2/55437ec6c1198d9616479ddb)!

*I own no content shown in the app, all of the links are resources that can be freely found on the internet*
